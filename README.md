# e-PlantShopping

A dynamic React-based e-commerce application designed for plant enthusiasts. This project demonstrates modern front-end development practices, focusing on scalable state management and interactive user interfaces.

## Key Features and Learning Objectives

* **Component-Based Architecture:** Created functional React components, composed and nested them to build a modular and maintainable UI.
* **React Hooks:** Implemented `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to efficiently manage component-level states and side effects.
* **Redux Integration:** Integrated Redux for global state management, applying core concepts including Actions, Reducers, and the Store.
* **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Dynamically rendered UI elements by fetching data from arrays of objects and using the `.map()` method to generate lists of components.
* **Event Handling:** Managed user interactions, such as button selections, to trigger actions that add or remove items from the shopping cart.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** Library for building the user interface.
* **Redux:** Global state management for the shopping cart.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic, array manipulation, and dynamic rendering.
* **CSS3:** Responsive styling for the plant nursery layout.
